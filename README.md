# Electricity Consumption Forecasting

## Overview

This project involves developing models to predict electricity consumption using data from Delhi, India. The goal is to provide accurate forecasts to aid in energy management and planning.

## Description

The project utilizes both Random Forest and ARIMA models to forecast electricity consumption. Various data visualization techniques are employed to identify trends and anomalies in the dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Random Forest, ARIMA, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Features

- **Time Series Forecasting:** Implemented Random Forest and ARIMA models to predict future electricity consumption.
- **Data Visualization:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and anomalies in the data.
- **Performance:** Achieved a prediction accuracy of 90%.
